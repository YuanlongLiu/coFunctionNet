# coFunctionNet

coFunctionNet aims to identify a collection of functional related gene entities that involves in multiple related phenotypes.
The input data for coFunctionNet is a weighted gene-gene connectome specific for each phenotype. The connectome integrates information of (1) gene-gene connection infomraion reveling gene functional relatedness. Typical gene-gene connection can resulted from protein-protein interaction, gene co-expression, regulation, or co-appearance in literature; (2) gene-phenotpe association signal quantifying the association evidence of a gene with the disease. This information can be obtained through Genome-wide association study or large scale gene-based analysis....
